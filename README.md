# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived the sinking or not. The model is trained on a dataset of passenger information, including characteristics such as age, gender, and passenger class.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## File Description

- `train.csv`: Dataset used to train a machine learning model that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
- `test.csv`: Dataset used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model in predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
- `submission.csv`: Contains the predictions made by a machine learning model on the test set of the Titanic dataset.
- `Titanic - Machine Learning.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the code for a machine learning model on the Titanic dataset. It includes code for training, prediction, and evaluation, and explanations of the steps taken.
