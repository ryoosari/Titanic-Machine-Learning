# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived the sinking or not. The model is trained on a dataset of passenger information, including characteristics such as age, gender, and passenger class.

## Getting Started

To use this code, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## File Description

- `train.py`: This script trains the model and saves it to a file.
- `predict.py`: This script loads the trained model and uses it to make predictions on the test set.
- `model.pkl`: This is the file where the trained model will be saved.
- `predictions.csv`: This is the file where the predictions on the test set will be saved.
- `dataset/`: This directory contains the training and test datasets.

## Credits

The dataset for this project was provided by Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
